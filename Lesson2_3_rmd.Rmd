## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

More about code chunks:
```{r qplot, fig.width=4, fig.height=3,message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
summary(cars)
qplot(speed, dist, data=cars)+
    geom_smooth()
```
Embed LaTeX or Math<L equations,
$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$

Footnotes, citations, and a bibliography. [^1]
